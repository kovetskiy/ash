Who ever wants a documentation if there is a gif?

Installation
============

Now `ash` is available only from `go get`:

```
go get github.com/seletskiy/ash
```

After that, `ash` executable should be available for use.

Important note
==============

`ash` is in a development phase, so it can crash unexpectedly.

*However*, all data you've entered will *not* be lost and will kept even
in case of crash.

If you experience a crash, *please*, fill an issue and attach `ash` debug
output (using `--debug=2` cmd line flag) and review file caused a crash.

Why
===

There is a couple points:

* Stash web-interface is, well, slow; it will eventually slow down when your
  review grows in number of comments; your editor probably will not;
* Sometimes Stash can lost comments you're entered in spite of having "Drafts";
* You can unleash all power of your editor in reviewing code by highlighting
  syntax, inserting snippets and even running code;

Usage
=====

Authorization
-------------

First of all, you need to specify login parameters for accessing Stash.

Easiest way to do that is to create config file named `~/.config/ash/ashrc`
and add following lines:

```
--user
  <your username here>

--pass
  <your password here>
```

Setting your editor
-------------------

To make `ash` use editor of your choice you need either to export `$EDITOR`
environment variable or just pass editor name to the `-e` flag.

You can use `ashrc` config too:

```
[... some other options goes here ...]

-e
 vim
```

### Using vim

Please, see https://github.com/kovetskiy/ash.vim. This plugin has decent
integration with ash.

Full blown integration is not ready yet (PR please!), but it is useful to have
following syntax highlights in `~/.vimrc` (one probably wants to change color
codes accordingly to colorscheme):

```
augroup syntax_hacks
    au!
    au FileType diff syn match DiffComment "^#.*"
    au FileType diff syn match DiffCommentIgnore "^###.*"
    au FileType diff call g:ApplySyntaxForDiffComments()
augroup end


fun! g:ApplySyntaxForDiffComments()
    if &background == 'light'
        hi DiffCommentIgnore ctermfg=249 ctermbg=none
        hi DiffComment ctermfg=16 ctermbg=254
    else
        hi DiffCommentIgnore ctermfg=249 ctermbg=none
        hi DiffComment ctermfg=15 ctermbg=237
    endif
endfun
```

### Using sublime

Because of sublime uses client-server architecture by default, editor
executable should be set in the way it will wait until review file editing is
done.

You need to create wrapper and place it somewhere (preferably in the $PATH)
`/path/to/sublw`:

```
#!/bin/sh

/path/to/sublime -w "${@}"
```

Then specify this shiny new executable (do not forget to `chmod +x` it) as
`ash` editor:

```
-e
 /path/to/sublw
```

Running ash
-----------

Now, using `ash` you can:

* list files in the review;
* review concrete file;
* see recent changes in overview mode;

Common usage of `ash` is:

```
ash inbox (only if --host given)
ash <pull request url> ls
ash <pull request url> review
ash <pull request url> review <file to review>
```

Reviewing
---------

You can modify review file which will be opened in editor by:

* entering new line comments just after line you want to comment; you need to
  use `#` prefix for these kind of lines;
* modifying existing comments by just altering their text in file;
* deleting existing comments by just deleting their body;
* adding review-level/file-level comments by entering them outside of the diff
  context;
* replying to the existing comments by entering reply lines of text with some
  indentation *after* comment delimiter `---`;

Tips and tricks
---------------

You can use shorthand syntax for accessing reviews without specifying full PR
url.

There are two flags for that:
* `--host` which used to specify Stash host (e.g. http://stash.local/);
* `--project` which used to specify default project to search repo/pull-request;

So, you can add following to your `ashrc`:
```
--host
  http://<your stash hostname>/

--project
  mycoolproject
```

Now you can run `ash` like this:
```
ash myrepo/123 review
ash notsocoolproject/anotherrepo/456 review
```

State of things
===============

* [x] fill todo list;
* [x] list files in review;
* [x] add, modify, delete line comments as well as review/file level comments;
* [x] make `ash` work in overview mode;
* [x] list reviews in project;
* [x] list inbox;
* [x] integrate `ash` with `vim` using `Unite` (PR is welcomed);
* [ ] integrate `ash` with `sublime` writing a plugin (PR is welcomed);
* [ ] be more tolerant to user mistakes (`ash` can crash sometime);
* [ ] wrap long lines in comments;
